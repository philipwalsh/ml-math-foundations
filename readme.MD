Machine Learning Math Foundations

I am currently taking a mini bootcamp, offered by [odsc](https://aiplus.odsc.com/pages/mlbootcamp), presented by [Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/)

during the bootcamp live training [sessions](https://www.jonkrohn.com/talks), i am following along with Jon's live code demos via his [github](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) notebooks and google colab

but this is an alternative to that approach, i am going to host the jupyter notebooks local via WSL 2.0 and work through the same math that Jon has presented during the bootcamp.

Step 1: install Windows Terminal (optional)
